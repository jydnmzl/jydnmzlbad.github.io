       			<h2 >KEEB Magazine Covers</h2>
                <p> I was tasked to create a magazine as a part of my second year digital graphic design class. I took my love for keyboards and tried to create some bold magazine covers with the name KEEB. These are three of the four issues that I created along with the logo which was also designed by me. The two "E" are meant to create a keyboard icon with the negative space and this was something I was kind of proud of.</p>

				<p> In 2021, I used to stream on twitch and create YouTube videos for the mechanical keyboards that I built for myself and for clients.It was a fun experience to create my own content for others in my small community to view and enjoy. I still build custom keyboards as a hobby but have kept it offline for my own enjoyment.

				<p> As a part of my final project in my highschool creative advertising course, my team was tasked in rebranding a local tea company named T by Daniel. I was in charge of the media production which included photography, videography and website design. Here are some of the product photos that I took and edited. My team ended up winning the comeptition and were asked to become part of his rebrand moving forward.
