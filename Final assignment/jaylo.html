				<p>In the Summer of 2021, I developed a small project business with a close friend of mine that focused on building custom mechanical keyboards and PCs for clients. We provided consultations, build services, optional photos and videos as well as local delivery. It was a spontaneous passion project that we thought would be fun during the pandemic. We ended up with a few clients that were close friends and created some content for our page. Ultimately, school and work got the best of us and we decided to keep our small business as a hobby.</p>
				<p> Hopefully in the future, with the knowledge I gain from the DMSM program, I can restart my small business with better strategies and consistency. For now, here are some of the photos that were taken and posted of client builds.</p>
